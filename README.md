## Project Files

`index.html`: Main HTML file

`css/`: Contains our `style.css` plus library files for Bootstrap and fullView

`data/`:
- `Visualization_Data.xlsx`: Initial data export of faculty information from https://www.seas.harvard.edu/
- `Final Visualization Data.xlsx`: Cleaned up version of `Visualization_Data.xlsx`
  - Seperated into individual .csv files for faculty profiles, centers, news, centers, and programs
- `faculty_coauthor_matrix.csv`: OUTDATED. Created by an older version of `misc_code/pubmed_webscrape_with_date.py`
- `per_paper_vals_v1.csv`: Contains publications written by Harvard faculty. Generated by `misc_code/pubmed_webscrape_with_date.py` (this is not an exhaustive list of papers). For each row, there's information about the paper, including a one-hot encoding of the authors, the title, the abstract, and the publish data (and the ID for the paper on the PubMed website)

`js/`: Contains our JS files listed below plus library files for jQuery, Bootstrap, and fullView
- `main.js`: Main JS file that loads in the data, creates the visualizations, and handles various button/menu interactions
- `adjMatrixVis.js`: Creates the adjacency matrix with coauthor publication data (interacts with `wordBarVis.js`)
- `chordVis.js`: Creates a chord visualization of inter-faculty relationships between Harvard buildings (interacts with `mapVis.js`)
- `groupDotsVis.js`: Creates the dot visualization with faculty departments and office locations
- `manyTableVis.js`: Creates the table visualization with faculty and research interest
- `mapVis.js`: Creates a map visualization with pins for faculty office locations (interacts with `nodeData.js` and `chordVis.js`)
- `nodeData.js`: Contains faculty data with coordinates for office locations
- `network.js`: Creates the network visualization with faculty nodes and inter-faculty relationship edges (interacts with `networkBarVis.js`)
- `networkBarVis.js`: Creates a faculty profile with photo and a bar graph with number of inter-faculty relationships (interacts with`network.js`)
- `relationshipVis.js`: Creates the relationship visualization with faculty, departments, and centers
- `wordbarVis.js`: Creates the word histogram (interacts with `adjMatrixVis.js`)

`misc_code/`:
- `pubmed_webscrape_with_date.py`: Our web scraping algorithm for getting the publications used for the coauthor matrix. Note: this was run once to generate `data/per_paper_vals_v1.csv`. This method is incomplete, and there are surely papers that were missed (based on limits of PubMed, or with problems with name matching, etc.)

`img/`: Contains background images and profile pictures. Harvard photos are from https://www.flickr.com/people/grinnell/
